# 🪐 Pygame Asteroids

A simple but fun clone of the classic **Asteroids** arcade game, built using **Python** and **Pygame**. This project was created as part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) game development course, and includes basic physics, shooting mechanics, and splitting asteroids!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Player-controlled spaceship that can rotate, thrust, and shoot
- Floating and splitting asteroids
- Collision detection and basic physics
- Modular code structure with OOP design

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

After installing requirements, run the game using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Use your keyboard to control the ship:

- 🔼 Up Arrow — Thrust
- ◀️ / ▶️ Left/Right Arrows — Rotate
- Spacebar — Shoot

## 📚 About the Project

This game was built as the final project for Boot.dev's "Build Your Own Asteroids Game" module. It demonstrates the use of Pygame, object-oriented programming, basic game physics, and a modular file structure.
